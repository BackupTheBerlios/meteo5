  STclass is a development environment for Java. It has been tested under Linux
  and Mac Os-X with Sun jdk 1.5.
  
  This document assumes you have some experience with shell commands, text 
  editors (such as GNU-emacs or Jedit) and a basic knowledge of the Java 
  development process
  .
  Requirements
  ------------
  
    To use STclass, you should have jdk (1.5 or later) installed on your 
    computer. You can freely download this piece of software:
      * jdk : [[http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads]]

    The scripts needed tu use STclass are written using Unix shell language. A
    Windows compatible version of STclass 4.0 might be released later.

    The STclass distribution contains also a copy of **JiP** (The Java 
    Interactive Profiler) ; not any download is needed, you can consult his 
    documentation on the JiP site (http://jiprof.sourceforge.net/).


  Installation
  ------------

    A tar-gzipped archive (or ziped archive for windows) is downloadable at the
    URL:
      http://stclass.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList

    In this kit you should find the 'javacst' preprocessor, the 'stclass.jar'
    library, the Java source examples we cite in this paper, and templates of 
    self-testable classes. 

    Under Linux, Mac Os-X or any Unix
    ---------------------------------

      The installation process is made in a terminal window :
        1. - Expand the archive with ''tar'' or ''unzip'' in any directory 
	  (named ''<install_dir>'' in the example commands),
        2. - run the command
	  
  ..> sh <install_dir>/etc/pkg_install.sh jhome=<path_to_your_java_home>
  
          that modify the ''setup'' files according to the <install_dir> 
	  directory and the 'JAVA_HOME' on our computer.

      At each working session beginning, the command
        'source <install_dir>/etc/setup.bash' or
	'source <install_dir>/etc/setup.tcsh''
      that will set the right ''PATH'' and ''CLASSPATH'' in our environment, 
      must be launched in your workspace. A good idea is to define an alias 
      'init_stclass' in our ''.profile'' or ''.cshrc'' file that launch this 
      command automaticaly.

    Under Windows
    -------------

      The setup and launch scripts for Windows have not been updated in the 
      4.0-rc version; they will be distributed in the next release.

    Installation verification
    -------------------------

      To verify our installation:
        1. - go to a temp directory,
        2. - copy (recursively) the 'example' project ('share/example' in the
	   <install_dir>) in this temp directory,
        3. - change dir ('cd') to example/ww,
        4. - launch the command
	
	    ..> javacst ../java/test/SetOfIntegers.java
	    
           the compilation should be performed without error,
        5. - launch the command
	
	    ..> runtest test.SetOfIntegers
	    
           the test should pass with success.
